## Project Structure
This is a Core/App project architecture. There are two included projects - one called Core, and one called Arcade(App). Premake is used to generate project files.
Core builds into a static library and is meant to contain common code intended for use in multiple games. Arcade builds into an executable and links the Core static library.

## Building the Project
The project uses Premake 5 as the build system. (Windows only support!)
1. Open CMD and type `git clone --recursive https://github.com/AhmedYAbbas/Arcade` to clone the repository. 
2. Navigate to the `Scripts` folder.
3. Run `Setup-Windows` to set up the Visual Studio solution.
4. Build and run the solution to start playing!
