# Arcade Game Collection

Welcome to the Arcade game collection! This project features four classic arcade games: Tetris, Asteroids, Breakout, and Pacman. Whether youâ€™re a fan of retro gaming or just looking for some nostalgic fun, this collection has something for everyone.

Made using SDL2 and C++.

***

## Project Structure
This is a Core/App project architecture. There are two included projects - one called Core, and one called Arcade(App). Premake is used to generate project files.
Core builds into a static library and is meant to contain common code intended for use in multiple games. Arcade builds into an executable and links the Core static library.
***
## Building the Project
The project uses Premake 5 as the build system. (Only supports x64 Windows for now!)
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Scripts` folder.
3. Run `Setup-Windows` to set up the Visual Studio solution.
4. Build and run the solution to start playing!
5. If you're having performance issues, make sure you're on the `Release` configuration and not the `Debug` configuration.
***

## Controls
- Arrow keys for movement and selection.
- 'A' key for actions.
